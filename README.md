# SpikeDeeptector in Python
This repository contains the SpikeDeeptector implementation in Python, originally designed by **Saif-ur-Rehman, et al. 2019** and implemented in Matlab [here](https://github.com/saifhanjra/SpikeDeeptector). Together with the Notebook presenting the implementation and a use example, find the Matlab scripts that can be used to get the model parameters and some evaluation data from the original implementation (`GetParameters.m`, `GetEvaluationData.m`, `GetActivations.m`). For space reasons, these are not included (`parameters.mat`, `data_evaluation.mat`). A Utah array recording for the use example can be found in the dataset published by **Brochier, et al. 2018** [here](https://gin.g-node.org/INT/multielectrode_grasp). Additionally, the BlackRock library `brpylib.py` to read Utah array recordings can be downloaded [here](https://www.blackrockmicro.com/wp-content/software/brPY.zip). The file `Report.pdf` gathers a detailed description of the toolbox, the context in which it was developed, and practical results of its application in data from neurorehabilitation tasks of a stroke patient.

Please write me if you have any question understanding the code (guillemboada@hotmail.com).
